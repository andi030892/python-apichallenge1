Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
You should create the following plots:
* Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

The requirements for "Part 1: WeatherPy" are the following
Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
The requirements for "Part 2: VacationPy" are the following

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
* Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition 
* For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates 
* Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
